# Starting with SOAP: rapid deployment of contact tracing technologies in a pandemic

This repository contains a white paper designed to support discussions and evaluations of potential contact tracing technologies, taking in perspectives from several disciplines engaged with the debate. These include:  

* the extent to which technologies supporting contact tracing **preserve individual or community privacy**; 
* the extent to which they’re **secure** from malicious or inadvertent misuse; 
* how suitable they are for **operational use** as part of a health authority’s response to an outbreak; 
* and the extent to which **assurance** of that technology - validating that it is working as intended - is possible.

SOAP has been designed with support from researchers across the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/), including computer scientists, cryptographers, legal scholars, epidemiologists, philosophers, data analysts, user researchers, anthropologists, engineers and social scientists. The technical, social, legal and contextual considerations it includes reflect the practicalities - and complexities - of designing and deploying technology solutions. These decisions cannot be left to one discipline, or one frame of reference. Ultimately, while the contributors to this document span a range of disciplines, we share two common goals: supporting contact tracing during a disease outbreak with responsible, safe technologies where it makes sense to deploy them; and ensuring citizens can trust that any technologies being deployed cannot and will not be used in ways that ultimately harm them.

## Next steps: creating a formal evaluation method using SOAP
This document simply provides an introduction to SOAP. It’s designed to encourage existing discussions regarding contact tracing technologies to engage with a broader range of considerations, and start to explore interdependencies and inconsistencies between solutions currently being proposed. In future versions of this framework, we are exploring:

* Creating a formal evaluation method, refining criteria by which technology solutions might be considered and assigning weights to each. Where aspects of a solution are negatively weighted, mitigation actions might be proposed
* Releasing high level assessments of specific proposed contact tracing solutions already in production, employing SOAP concepts
* Turning a high level SOAP overview into a visual tool using systems concepts
* Creating guidance and training to support organisations bringing together related and interdependent perspectives shaping contact tracing technologies
